Dear Students,
Hope this email finds you well, many students asking about the poster structure, it is should contain:
1. Introduction
2. Methodology
3. Results
4. Conclusion
5. References ( you should use at least 4 references)
you can use data from your lab handbook, but also you need to make your own research.
The total degree will be out of 15 as following:
- over all structure of the poster 5 Marks
- quality of the graphs and mistakes 5 Marks
- Novelty and using different references 5 Marks

The final dead line will be 30.5.2020
